Ceylon Cinnamon is called Sweet, Good Cinnamon or Real cinnamon in the market. This is an authentic product from Sri Lanka, the bark from the plant called Cinnamomum Zeylanicum. The sticks are filled a cigar type several folded layers.

In case of ground cinnamon, it is very difficult to distinguish between the two unless you are an expert, especially at sniffing spices. Howler, there is no guarantee that the result will be one hundred percent accurate. However, in case of sticks, it is easier to differentiate between the two. The following table and pictures highlight some of the differences which shall help you to choose the correct type.

Most bottled or packaged ground cinnamon does not mention its type or origin. It is, therefore, difficult to ascertain its type and origin or the country or plant. The best course is to identify the sticks and make sure that you are buying the Ceylon variety. Once you get hold of the real “thing”, use your blender to crush it into powder
